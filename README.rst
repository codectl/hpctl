A CLI utility tool for interacting and managing an HPC computer cluster.

Setup ðŸ”§
=====
The project uses `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`__ for dependency management
. Therefore to set up the project, one would do:

.. code-block:: bash

    # ensure poetry is installed
    $ poetry env use python3
    $ poetry install

That will configure a virtual environment for the project and install the respective
dependencies, which is particular useful during development stage.

Run ðŸš€
====
Since it is a CLI program, the list of available operations is given by running the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ hpctl
    > ...

Tests & linting ðŸš¥
===============
Run tests with ``tox``:

.. code-block:: bash

    # ensure tox is installed
    $ tox

Run linter only:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tox -e lint

Optionally, run coverage as well with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tox -e coverage
